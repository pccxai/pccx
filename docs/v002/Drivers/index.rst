==================
Software Stack
==================

The pccx v002 driver is a C/C++ hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
plus a thin public API. Its responsibilities:

- Encoding and dispatching 64-bit VLIW instructions via the CMD_IN FIFO.
- Preloading shape / size pointers and scale factors through ``MEMSET``.
- Driving DMA between the host DDR4 and the NPU L2 cache.
- Polling ``STAT_OUT`` for async completion.

The implementation lives under
:file:`codes/v002/sw/driver/uCA_v1_api.h` /
:file:`uCA_v1_api.c` and carries forward the v001 design with minor
comment updates for the pccx v002 ISA reference URL.

.. admonition:: Implementation status
   :class: warning

   v002 driver is at **bring-up** stage: the public ``uca_*`` API
   surface compiles and the AXI-Lite HAL skeleton exists, but the
   end-to-end ``MEMSET → MEMCPY → GEMV → MEMCPY readback`` flow has
   not yet been validated against the RTL on hardware. See
   :doc:`../Verification/index` §2 for the open verification items.

.. note::

   PCCX Launcher is discontinued. Driver contributions do not require
   a separate launcher. Track current board and runtime work in
   `KV260 issues <https://github.com/pccxai/pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260/issues>`_
   and :doc:`/docs/Evidence/index`.
