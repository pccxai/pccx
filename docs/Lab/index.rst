pccx-lab Handbook
=================

**pccx-lab** is the desktop profiler + verification IDE for the pccx v002
NPU. It ingests ``.pccx`` binary traces emitted by the xsim testbench
suite on the companion ``pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260`` RTL repo and surfaces
the timeline, roofline, bottleneck windows, waveform, Vivado synth
reports, and natural-language UVM-sequence strategies in a single
Tauri v2 window.

This section documents the tool's internal surface — the Phase 1
plugin-registry primitive every crate hangs trait objects off, the
current workflow facade + ``pccx-lsp`` LSP façade, the
command-line binaries distributed across crates after the workspace
split, and the research-lineage placeholder that will refresh once the
citation registry lands in its new home.

For the user-facing desktop app itself, see the separate
`pccx-lab site <https://labs.pccx.ai/>`_.

      Repo layout, layer contract, data flow, extension hooks.

      ``pccx_cli``, ``generator``, ``from_xsim_log``,
      ``pccx_golden_diff`` — the four binaries pccx-lab ships today
      and the surfaces still awaiting re-landing.

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`graph;1em;sd-mr-1` Analyzer API
      :link: analyzer_api
      :link-type: doc

      The ``PluginRegistry<P>`` primitive, its ``Plugin`` /
      ``PluginMetadata`` supertraits, and how each crate hangs its own
      plugin trait off it.

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`beaker;1em;sd-mr-1` Workflow Facade
      :link: workflow_facade
      :link-type: doc

      The workflow facade static helpers (``compress_context``,
      ``generate_uvm_sequence``, ``list_uvm_strategies``) and the
      Phase 2 ``pccx-lsp`` provider traits + ``LspMultiplexer``.

   .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`shield-check;1em;sd-mr-1` FPGA synthesis guardrails
      :link: fpga-synthesis-automation-guardrails
      :link-type: doc

      Artifact-first synthesis automation boundaries, preflight rules,
      evidence states, queue fields, and Trace/Evolve review packet shape.

      Placeholder while the citation registry is rebuilt — the
      pre-Phase-1 ``pccx_core::research::CITATIONS`` module was
      removed in the module exodus and has not yet re-landed.
